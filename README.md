# trainSynthesis
## Synthesising the sounds of a train using pure data

## TODO:
  - Research what makes up the sounds of a train
  - create a small library of reference files for train sounds
  - create a library of reference samples of the individual elements of the sound (where possible)

## What makes up the sounds of a train:

- Low rumble

- higher pitcher 'rumble'
    - this gets higher as the train increases in speed
    
- noise of going over bumps
    - this repeats itself but getting quieter as other bits of the train go over the bumps

- breaking noises
    - very high pitched, quite loud, squeals

- clattering sounds
    - the train straining as it goes round corners?

- air suspension sounds
