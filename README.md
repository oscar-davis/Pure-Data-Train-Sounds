# trainSynthesis
Synthesising the sounds of a train using pure data

- using a combination of sounds:
  - motor sound
  - wheel sound
  - rushing air sound


  ## TODO:
  - Research what makes up the sounds of a train
  - create a small library of reference files for train sounds
  - create a library of reference samples of the individual elements of the sound (where possible)
